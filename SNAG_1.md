##  #1 **_Condenser Selection Below Targeted Value_**

**Issue:** Stating that a condenser is required with 69.2kW of THR
Coil with less capacity wasa supplied.

###Explanation
The logic is to search for a target.
Show all models that are within tolerance.
If no models found to be within tolerance, then show the closest.

###Program update.
I have now added a list of 3 below and 3 above the target.
This fixes the problem of the 1 below target being shown.
