##  #16 **_Compressor Product Selection Condensing selection_**

**Issue:** Units are designed on a fixed selection as per the MTC catalogue.


**Result:** Rather work on an ambient value, add the condensing dT to that value to determine the condensing temperature.
##### MT - Medium Temperature = 15K
##### HT - High Ambient Medium Temperature = 10K
##### LT - Low Temperature = 13K
##### HL - High Ambient Medium Temperature = 10K

Supply the user with the option to select an application (from the Spec. Kind, maybe also have a drop down section)

**Side Note for your information:** Some units will be able to run at lower dT values, but we keep the capacities at a fixed value to meet
the catalogues criteria
