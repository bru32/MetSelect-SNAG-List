**Result:** Look at the third and forth symbol in the product nomeclature, as that indicates the application.
##### MT - Medium Temperature (Holding Only)
##### HT - High Ambient Medium Temperature (Holding and Pull Down applications for higher ambients)
##### LT - Low Temperature (Holding Only)
##### HL - High Ambient Medium Temperature (Holding and Pull Down applications for higher ambients)

Supply the user with the option to select an application (from the Spec. Kind, maybe have it as a drop down section)
