##  #3 **_Condenser Selection Search doesn't take altitude into consideration_**

**Issue:** Altitude correction factor wasn't taken into consideration for the required capacity.

### Fixed by Bruce Wernick, 12 March 2019

The altitude correction was left out of the selection.
This is now corrected.
