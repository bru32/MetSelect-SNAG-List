##  #10 **_Temp Diff Symbol to be changed_**

**Issue:** Unit Cooler / Condenser Selection Temp Diff Symbol **C** for Celcius.


### Done.
This is not really an error but a preference.
I have changed delta temp units to K.


 **Result:** Unit Cooler Selection Temp Diff Symbol to be **K** for Kelvin
