##  #5 **_Condenser Capacity discrepancy between refrigerants_**

**Issue:** Condenser capacity lower on R407F compared to R404A.

**R407F - Recam Catalogue HAC5035 at sea level _69.07kW THR_**


### Status: Waiting for information from Metraclark
In the mean time, I have added provisional factors for all refrigerants.
The logic is working.
I just need to update the condenser refrigerant factors.



**Catalogue:** Recam Condenser Catalogue Refrigeration Capacity Values
