##  #6 **_Condenser name displayed irregularity_**

**Issue:** Different names supplied for the same capacity on the V-Coil selection.

### Fixed by Bruce Wernick 12 March 2019

The problem was that old database files were left in the data folder.
These have been removed and the problem is resolved.
